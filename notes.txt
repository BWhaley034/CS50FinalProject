Test

Powershell:

md (make directory)
new-item (create a new folder/file)
remove-item
rm (remove)
cd (change directory)

With the exeption of the form, most of the content between the current_lot and finished_lot should be the same, can make one template 
    for both current and finished and just change the form somehow?
    lot_display inherits from template, current_lot and finished_lot inherit from lot_display?


Submit Log:
Test:
    - SG (with associated must temp)
    - Acidity (with types of reading, strip or titratable)
    - Temperature
Log:
    - Actions:
        - Added compound (fining agent, Campden, yeast (slurry or dry)) with entry for qty and text for notes
        - Yeast starter (Started and/or notes)
Maybe just start out with a basic notes Log



Do these three need different templates? Or would a single template be sufficient?

new_lot should have a form for STARTING a batch (and needs a button on the main page)
    After initial data filled out, should redirect to a current lot 

current_lot should be for already started batches that haven't been bottled
    - Temperature graph (selectable time range)

finished_lot should be for lots that have been bottled
